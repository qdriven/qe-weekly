What OpenBOM Does (and Doesn’t Do) Well
In a nutshell, OpenBOM can do the following:
 
Flexible data management, multi-tenant data sharing, real-time simultaneous data editing (à la Google Sheets)
Out-of-the-box parts management and the parts revisions lifecycle
Multi-level BOMs automatically generated from leading SMB CAD systems, such as Solidworks, Autodesk, and OnShape, with manually-added cost, rollup calculation, and online collaboration
Production planning, e.g., the EBOM to Manufacturing BOM (BOM) syncing
Vendors and purchasing management
Downstream data sharing and coordination
Out-of-the-box PDM and ERP software integration (OpenBOM has recently been certified on the SuiteCloud platform and integrated with Oracle NetSuite cloud ERP)
